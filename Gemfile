# Jekyll 4, built and deployed by GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/pages.yml).
#
# This deliberately does NOT use the `github-pages` gem. That gem pins Jekyll 3.9
# and Liquid 4.0.3, and Liquid 4.0.3 calls Object#tainted?, which Ruby removed in
# 3.2. The practical effect is that on any currently supported Ruby the site
# cannot be built at all:
#
#   Liquid Exception: undefined method 'tainted?' for an instance of Integer
#
# Building with Actions instead of the legacy branch builder costs one repository
# setting (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) and removes the version
# ceiling entirely.
